UAC is a Live Response collection script for Incident Response that makes use of native binaries and tools to automate the collection of AIX, Android, ESXi, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, NetBSD, NetScaler, OpenBSD and Solaris systems artifacts. It was created to facilitate and speed up data collection, and depend less on remote support during incident response engagements.

## üåü Main Features

- Run everywhere with no dependencies (no installation required).
- Customizable and extensible collections and artifacts.
- Respect the order of volatility during artifact collection.
- Collect information from processes running without a binary on disk.
- Hash running processes and executable files.
- Extract information from files and directories to create a bodyfile (including enhanced file attributes for ext4).
- Collect user and system configuration files and logs.
- Collect artifacts from applications.
- Acquire volatile memory from Linux systems using different methods and tools.

## üíæ Supported Operating Systems

UAC runs on any Unix-like system (regardless of the processor architecture). All UAC needs is shell :)

## üöÄ Using UAC

UAC does not need to be installed on the target system. You only need to download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/releases), uncompress and run it. As simple as that!

A profile name and/or a list of artifacts, and the destination directory need to be provided to run a collection. The remaining parameters are optional.

> **Full Disk Access** permission is a privacy feature introduced in macOS Mojave (10.14) that prevents some applications from accessing important data, such as Mail, Messages, and Safari files. So it is strongly recommended that you manually [grant permission for Terminal application](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-access-to-system-configuration-files-mchlccb25729/mac) before running UAC from the terminal, or [grant permission for remote users](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-a-remote-computer-to-access-your-mac-mchlp1066/mac) before running UAC via ssh.

Common usage scenarios may include the following:

**Collect all artifacts based on the ```full``` profile, and create the output file in ```/tmp```.**

```shell
./uac -p full /tmp
```

**Collect all ```live_response```, and the ```bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml``` artifact, and create the output file in the current directory.**

```shell
./uac -a live_response/\*,bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml .
```

**Collect all artifacts based on the ```full``` profile, but exclude the ```bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml``` artifact, and create the output file in ```/tmp```.**

```shell
./uac -p full -a \!bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml /tmp
```

**Collect the memory dump, then all artifacts based on the ```full``` profile.**

```shell
./uac -a artifacts/memory_dump/avml.yaml -p full /tmp
```

**Collect the memory dump, then all artifacts based on the ```ir_triage``` profile excluding the ```bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml``` artifact.**

```shell
./uac -a ./artifacts/memory_dump/avml.yaml -p ir_triage -a \!artifacts/bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml /tmp
```

**Collect all artifacts based on the ```full``` profile, but limit the data collection based on the date range provided.**

```shell
./uac -p full /tmp --date-range-start 2021-05-01 --date-range-end 2021-08-31
```

**Collect all but live response artifacts from a Linux disk image mounted in ```/mnt/ewf```.**

```shell
./uac -p full -a \!live_response/\* /tmp --mount-point /mnt/ewf --operating-system linux
```

Please check the [project documentation page](https://tclahr.github.io/uac-docs) for more information about command line options, how to create your own artifacts, profiles, and more!
